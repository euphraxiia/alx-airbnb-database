# Database Normalization Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb database schema to ensure it adheres to Third Normal Form (3NF) principles. Normalization eliminates data redundancy and ensures data integrity by organising data into logically structured tables.

## Normalization Levels

### First Normal Form (1NF)

**Definition**: A relation is in 1NF if:
- Each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values
- Each row is unique
- No repeating groups or arrays

**Analysis of Current Schema**:

✅ **All tables are in 1NF**
- All attributes contain atomic values (strings, integers, dates, etc.)
- Each table has a proper primary key ensuring row uniqueness
- No repeating groups or multi-valued attributes found

**Examples**:
- `User.email` is a single atomic string value ✓
- `Property.address_line1` is atomic (not a complex structure) ✓
- `Booking.status` is a single enum value ✓

---

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Definition**: A relation is in 2NF if:
- It is in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key
- No partial dependencies (attributes depending on only part of a composite key)

**Analysis of Current Schema**:

✅ **All tables are in 2NF**

**Detailed Analysis**:

1. **User Table**:
   - Primary Key: `id`
   - All attributes (first_name, last_name, email, etc.) fully depend on `id` ✓

2. **Property Table**:
   - Primary Key: `id`
   - All attributes fully depend on `id`
   - `owner_id` is a foreign key (properly normalized) ✓

3. **Booking Table**:
   - Primary Key: `id`
   - All attributes fully depend on `id`
   - `property_id` and `guest_id` are foreign keys ✓

4. **PropertyAmenity (Junction Table)**:
   - Composite Primary Key: `(property_id, amenity_id)`
   - This table has no non-key attributes beyond the composite key itself
   - Properly handles many-to-many relationship ✓

5. **All Other Tables**: Similar analysis confirms 2NF compliance ✓

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Definition**: A relation is in 3NF if:
- It is in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes)
- Every non-key attribute must be non-transitively dependent on the primary key

**Analysis of Current Schema**:

#### ✅ **Most tables are in strict 3NF**

However, there is one potential transitive dependency concern:

#### Potential Issue: Property Address Fields

**Location**: `Property` table

**Concern**: The relationship between `postal_code` → `city`, `state`, `country`
- In many countries, postal codes functionally determine city/state/country
- If `postal_code` determines `city`, `state`, and `country`, then these attributes have a transitive dependency on `postal_code` (a non-key attribute)
- This violates 3NF if postal_code uniquely determines location components

**Evaluation**:
1. **In practice**: Postal codes do not always uniquely determine cities/states (some cities have multiple postal codes, boundary cases exist)
2. **Data integrity**: Storing address components directly with properties is standard practice and supports international variations
3. **Performance**: Denormalizing address components avoids joins and improves query performance
4. **Flexibility**: Allows for properties with non-standard addresses or addresses that don't map cleanly to postal codes

**Decision**: The current schema **remains in 3NF** because:
- Postal code does not strictly functionally determine city/state/country in all cases
- The dependency is more of a data integrity constraint than a normalization violation
- The practical benefits of keeping address components with properties outweigh strict normalization

#### Alternative (Strict 3NF Option)

If strict 3NF compliance is desired, we could introduce a `Location` or `PostalCode` reference table:

```
Location {
    id (PK)
    postal_code (unique)
    city
    state
    country
    created_at
    updated_at
}

Property {
    ...
    location_id (FK → Location.id)
    address_line1
    address_line2
    latitude
    longitude
    ...
}
```

However, this approach:
- Adds complexity with an additional join
- May not work well for all international address formats
- Provides limited benefit given postal code uniqueness is not guaranteed

---

## Additional Design Considerations

### Denormalization Decisions

The schema includes some intentional denormalization for performance:

1. **Booking.total_price**:
   - Could be calculated from `Property.price_per_night × number_of_nights`
   - **Rationale**: Storing calculated value improves performance and preserves historical pricing even if property price changes
   - **Status**: Acceptable design choice, not a normalization violation

2. **Property.coordinates**:
   - `latitude` and `longitude` could theoretically be derived from address, but geocoding is not always accurate
   - **Rationale**: Stored separately for query performance and accuracy
   - **Status**: Acceptable, not a normalization concern

### Current Schema Strengths

1. ✅ Proper use of junction tables for many-to-many relationships (`PropertyAmenity`)
2. ✅ Foreign keys properly establish relationships without duplicating data
3. ✅ Each entity type is in its own table
4. ✅ No redundant data storage
5. ✅ Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) are appropriately placed in each table

---

## Conclusion

### ✅ **Current Schema Status: 3NF Compliant**

The database schema is **already in Third Normal Form (3NF)**. The schema demonstrates:

1. **1NF Compliance**: All attributes are atomic
2. **2NF Compliance**: All non-key attributes are fully dependent on primary keys
3. **3NF Compliance**: No transitive dependencies exist that violate normalization principles

The potential postal code → location dependency is not a strict 3NF violation due to the lack of a functional dependency relationship in practice.

### Recommendations

1. **Maintain Current Structure**: The current schema is well-normalized and appropriate for an Airbnb-like application
2. **Data Integrity**: Consider adding database constraints or application-level validation to ensure address components are consistent with postal codes
3. **Performance**: The current denormalization (e.g., `total_price`) is appropriate for read-heavy workloads
4. **Future Considerations**: If location-based queries become complex, consider adding a spatial index on coordinates or introducing a location reference table for standardization
